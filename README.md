## Title
### Kantongin: Personal financial tracker app with shopping receipt scan feature

## Summary
In this modern era, we as millennials often make various transactions because of the increasing
number of needs, such as buying food and drinks, Netflix subscriptions, clothes, etc. because
of our many needs, we often forget what goods or services we have purchased or used, so it is
difficult to evaluate or track what goods have been bought and how much money has been
spent on them. So the question is, how do we track our expenses easily and at the same time
digitize the physical notes we already have? Based on these problems, we are trying to build an
application to remind users of what expenses have been made in the form of financial records.
This application was created to allow users to collect receipts, slips, and other small papers in
the form of soft copies into this application so that users know every expenditure that has
been made so far simply by looking at each expense history in the application when they are
surprised to find out where their money has been used.
